        <p>
        musicians of all levels of popularity have been cancelling shows and tours because of the CoronaVirus pandemic. We all know how important it is right now to protect each other and those who are especially immunocompromised. I believe it is also important to support our music community. In the spirit of my podcast Songwriter’s Therapy, I’d like to try something new to help our community stay connected and share music while avoiding mass gatherings that may be dangerous. If any bands or musicians in the Stockton area would like to be part of a live streaming concert series please reach out to me. Love each other.
